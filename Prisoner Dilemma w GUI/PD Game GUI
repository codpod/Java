 Prisoner’s Dilemma Game reimplemented as a Java Swing application

Contains two major panels (additional JPanels may be nested for layout purpose). The left panel has a JList of the games that have been completed. When a game is
selected, its statistics will be displayed in the corresponding JTextFields (e.g., how
many rounds the game lasted, what strategy the computer used, the total sentences for the player and computer, and the winner of the game).

The right panel is for the ongoing game. It has a JButton called “Start New Game” and a JComboBox that allows you to select the computer’s strategy. 
It has two additional JButtons (“Remain Silent” and “Testify”) that allow the player to decide what to do each round. 
It also has a JTextArea to display prompts for the player and the results as the game is played.
