A frame that has a “Mainpanel” covering it and the class MainPanel.java consists of a toolbar, and two subpanels. Choose different colors for the items.

In constructor for MainPanel we fill a static one D array(imagaA) with images of the 5 gifs using toolkit

When user clicks one of the 5 buttons in the tool bar on top panel, this calls a button listener method (actionPerformed) and 
sets a variable (“selectedTile”) in the code for the yellow center panel (TileGridPanel.java).

Then when user clicks on any spot in the yellow area  (mouse click), this calls a mouse listener method in TileGridPanel.java and you fill a 5x 5 gif array 
with the selected image chosen from the static array in MainPanel.java.
Then fire paint event to paint the 5 x 5 grid in the center of the yellow panel
