Practices writing multiple Java classes, and using several Java
library classes to do I/O and simple collection operation, such as Scanner,
ArrayList and HashMap

The user will start their “session”. The “session” will be 1 or more games, each
game is 5 rounds.
The user will first select an opposing “computer strategy”. Once the game begins,
the user will play 5 rounds for one “game” against the computer with the strategy
chosen. The user can cooperate or betray in each round. The computer can
cooperate or betray in each round as well and then we reach an outcome for that
round.
At the end of the 5 round game, a final score will be printed for the 5 rounds, and
the player who had the lowest total years for that 5 round game will be declared the
winner. Then the user will be prompted if they would like to play again in their
session. In addition, the program saves the statistics of all the games in the session
based on date/time and when the session is over, an overall summary of all games
played in the session will be printed before program finishes.Scoring:
If both the players remain silent (both players choose 1), both get 2 years in prison.
If the player betrays (choose 2) and the computer remains silent (choose 1), the
player gets 1 year in prison and the computer gets 5 years in prison.
If the player stays silent and the computer betrays, the player gets 5 years in prison
and the computer gets 1 year in prison.
If both the player and the computer betray (both choose 2) , both get 3 years in
prison. Below is the summary, 1 means stay silent, 2 means betray.
Player,   computer player years,    computer years
1,1               2 year                2 years
2,1               1 years               5 years
1,2               5 year                1 years
2 2               3 years               3 years
