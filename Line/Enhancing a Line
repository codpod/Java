Practice writing Java classes, packages, adding variables and methods to the class, as well as exception throwing and handling. 

The output of the program should have informational messages after (and/or before) each operation so the user knows what is being attempted and what the result was. 
Reading the output from the program should make it clear to the reader what the sequence of operations was and what happened
